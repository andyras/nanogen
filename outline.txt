### Ligand object
##  Parameters
#   coordinates for each atom
#   z axis
#   angle of rotation
##  Methods
# rotate

### Nano object
##  Parameters
#   Cartesian coordinates for each atom
#   origin (center of nanoparticle)
#   <vector> of surface atoms
##  Method for finding surface atoms
#   Find number of nearest neighbors, bin accordingly
    have a certain tolerance
#   Sort by distance from center
#   Find atoms which *could* accommodate ligand if it were placed there
    this will determine surface sites available to determine coverage later on
##  Method to find origin
#   average of x,y,z coordinates of all atoms
##  Method to shift coordinates to center at origin
##  Method to add ligand
#   rotate ligand such that it is aligned with line from origin to surface atom
#   place ligand such that atoms closest to origin are at r=(r_{surface atom} + 1-2 AA)
#   bring ligand closer until atoms start to overlap with potential surface atom.
#   test if there is overlap with other atoms in nanoparticle
#   if there is overlap, rotate about z axis and try again


### Main routine
##  Parameters to pass
#   -s seed for random surface site choosing
#   -c % surface coverage
#   -l ligand file
#   -v van der Waals tolerance
#   default parameter is input file of nanoparticle coordinates


### Routine to add ligand to nanoparticle
##  takes ligand and nanoparticle as parameters
##  choose a random available surface atom
##  try to add ligand there (rotate as necessary)

### Ligand file format
##  first line is denticity of ligand (1-3)
##  second line is number of surface atoms bound
#   1-3 for monodentate ligands
#   1-2 for bidentate ligands
#   1 for tridentate ligands
##  next lines are dummy surface atoms to which ligand is bound.
##  next lines are atoms in .xyz format
